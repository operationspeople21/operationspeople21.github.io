Over time, these methods have evolved with increases in computational power and the need to address a broader range of factors in decision making.  There has also been a greater focus on engagement with partners in the community and school districts.  The talk will present an ongoing collaboration with community and school district partners focused on student assignment.  We will present an overview of the process and the interactive optimization and data visualization tool used to facilitate discussions.|
