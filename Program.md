All times PT. Timings may be updated. During the breaks we will host informal chats on Gather.

| ------------- |:-------------:|
|7:50&nbsp;-&nbsp;8&nbsp;am | Welcome |
|8&nbsp;-&nbsp;8:45&nbsp;am | **Keynote 1: Karen Smilowitz** <br> Title:  Building optimization models with community partners: rethinking student assignment in public school districts. <br> <br> Operations research methods have been used to identify and evaluate solutions to the reconfiguration of public school attendance area boundaries for over fifty years.  Over time, these methods have evolved with increases in computational power and the need to address a broader range of factors in decision making.  There has also been a greater focus on engagement with partners in the community and school districts.  The talk will present an ongoing collaboration with community and school district partners focused on student assignment.  We will present an overview of the process and the interactive optimization and data visualization tool used to facilitate discussions.|

|12:30&nbsp;-&nbsp;1:15&nbsp;pm | **Keynote 2: Sean Meyn** <br> Title: Irrational Agents and the Power Grid - Does ERCOT 2021 Teach Us Something New?  <br><br> For decades, power systems academics have proclaimed the need for real time prices to create a more efficient energy grid.   The rationale is economics 101: proper price signals will lead to an efficient outcome.  The mathematics is elegant — who doesn’t love Lagrange multipliers?  However, application of this mathematics to electric power markets cannot be justified.  This harsh assessment is based on a casual review of economics 101;  in particular, the definition of efficiency.   The conclusions of the power economist are correct if the population of rational power consuming agents have a concave utility function that models preference for electric power.  However, in the real world, a typical user of electric power knows this is absurd.   Look at any of the big power consumers at your own home:  is your personal welfare a continuous function of the electric power consumed by each device?    The absurdity is most clear for on-off loads such as a water heater, refrigerator, A/C or pool pump.    The creation of a realistic economic model requires that we talk to humans.  We might learn that a particular agent uses a refrigerator to keep food cold, and a water heater to help keep their family and their dishes clean.  It follows that  the electrical energy products of interest to this agent are complex functions of time, and only loosely related to electric power -- the quantity associated with price signals, and in particular the price surges witnessed at ERCOT this year and in 2011.    There is a longer history in the communications sector where surge pricing was promoted, and then dismissed based on similar reasoning.   To realize a reliable energy grid and to promote innovation, we must abandon the dogma of surge pricing.   Alternatives will be surveyed in the lecture.|
